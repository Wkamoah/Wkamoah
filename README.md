# 👋🏾 Hey, I’m Winfred Kofi Amoah

I'm a **Ghanaian student currently based in Moscow**, transitioning into **Quality Assurance (QA)** with a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and a deep commitment to personal growth, teamwork, and excellence. My journey is far from traditional—but it's real, built on discipline, resilience, and a drive to contribute to something bigger than myself.

I'm fluent in **English** (both in communication and writing), conversational in **Russian (B1)**, and bring leadership experience from managing businesses to leading student bodies. I’m currently learning **manual testing** (test cases, bug reporting, QA workflows) while preparing for the **ISTQB Foundation certification in August 2025**. I plan to take a full **QA course on Udemy in June** to strengthen my practical skills and portfolio.

My goal is clear: **Secure a remote Junior QA role by November 2025**, contribute to building better software, and grow steadily into automation testing from there.
